libident 0.32
--------------
# A serious portability fix for *BSD and Solaris was submitted by:
  Nicolas Rachinsky <nicolas@rachinsky.de>.

# Build of sample programs ("testers") was fixed.


libident 0.31
--------------
# libtool is used instead of ranlib, so that a shared library can be built
  automatically if the OS supports it.


libident 0.30
--------------
#  This new release is meant to provide Internet Protocol version independant
  support: libident can now handles IPv6 addresses and perform queries over
  IPv6, as well as IPv4. The IP version is selected automatically.

# I also have ported the library to the GNU autotools (autoconf & automake),
  and removed support for non ANSI C platforms. If you use such an old system,
  do NOT update. It doesn't support IPv6 anyway.
