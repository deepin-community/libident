Libident C library
-------------------

  This is a library which provides a simple interface to the Ident protocol
on the client side. It is meant to be used by daemons to try to authenticate
users using the Ident protocol. For this to work, users need to have an Ident
server running on the system from which they are connected.

See also:
  COPYING for copyright issues,
  AUTHORS for authoring informations,
  NEWS for changes between releases,
  INSTALL for general compilation and installation instructions.


The official FTP site and location for libident was:

	ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/ident/libs

However, it seems to be unmaintained and I couldn't reach Peter Eriksson,
the original author, so far. Newer versions of the library may be found at:

	http://rdenisc.free.fr/libident/


  The ident-tester.c file is a small daemon (to be started from Inetd)
that does an ident lookup on you if you telnet into it. Can be used
to verify that your Ident server is working correctly.
